        Our community has identified project ideas that we believe will significantly enhance the Typelevel ecosystem.
        Nothing is set in stone: we may be able to adjust a projectâ€™s length and difficulty so that it is a good fit for you.
        So if you see something here that interests you or have an idea of your own, please get in touch!
