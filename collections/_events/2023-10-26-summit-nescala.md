## About the Summit

The tenth Typelevel Summit will once again be co-hosted with the [Northeast Scala Symposium](http://www.nescala.org/) virtually, with one of day of talks and one day of unconference, accompanied by discussion and socializing online throughout.

The schedule for this year is as follows:

* October 26 (Thursday): Typelevel Summit
* October 27 (Friday): NE Scala 2023
* October 28 (Saturday): Unconference

The Summits are open to all, not just current contributors to and users of the Typelevel projects, and we are especially keen to encourage participation from people who are new to them.
Whilst many of the Typelevel projects use somewhat "advanced" Scala, they are a lot more approachable than many people think, and a major part of Typelevel's mission is to make the ideas they embody much more widely accessible.
If you're interested in types and pure functional programming we'd love to see you here!

This is a community conference and we strive to make it an inclusive and fulfilling event for all participants.
All attendees, speakers, and organizers must abide by the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](/conduct.html).
