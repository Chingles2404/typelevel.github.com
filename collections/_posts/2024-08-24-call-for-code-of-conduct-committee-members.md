Are you passionate about fostering a positive and inclusive community?
Do you want to help shape how Typelevel works with the community to build a respectful environment for all?
Weâ€™re excited to announce this call for new members to the Typelevel Code of Conduct Committee!

Earlier this year Typelevel adopted a [new Code of Conduct][new-coc] that encompasses both organization and affiliate projects.
The Typelevel Code of Conduct Committee's mission is to enforce that Code of Conduct to help maintain community trust and safety.
We'd like your help in that mission!


Responsibilities
----------------

- Upholding the Code of Conduct and following through with the procedures outlined in the [Enforcement Policy][enforcement-policy]
- Completing Code of Conduct enforcement training such as that offered by [Otter Technology][otter-tech-training] (paid for by Typelevel)
- Willingness to contribute time and effort to committee activities, such as responding to reports in a timely manner
- Upholding community trust by ensuring transparency and accountability in their actions.


Applying
--------

Send an email to volunteer@typelevel.org to put yourself forward for consideration, please include why you wish to join.
The email is visible only to [Typelevel Steering Committee membership][steering-committee].
We will thoughtfully consider all serious applications and be discreet in our deliberation.
Accepted candidacies will be public, but we will not disclose the identity of anyone else that applies.

The call will be open for three weeks.
