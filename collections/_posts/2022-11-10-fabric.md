I know what you're thinking! "A new JSON library? Why? Don't we have plenty of those?" Well, the short answer is a
resounding yes, but this library was born of the frustrations felt using those existing libraries. Don't get me wrong,
there are some great JSON libraries in Scala and it's not my purpose to disparage them.  However, I assume others found
the same frustrations I did with the existing libraries. This library benefited a great deal from the things I liked
about the existing libraries and I went to great pains to make sure it didn't suffer from the same downsides they did.

Once I wrote the library I wanted to do some sanity-checking to make sure the performance wasn't substantially worse
than the existing solutions. Much to my surprise, the initial performance was generally faster than Circe or uPickle.
After some additional tuning, [Fabric][fabric] is outperforming the alternatives: [Benchmarks][benchmarks] ([Source][benchmarks-source])

[Check it out][fabric] and please give feedback if there's anything we can do to improve it.
