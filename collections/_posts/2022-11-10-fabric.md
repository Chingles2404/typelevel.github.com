I know what you're thinking! "A new JSON library? Why? Don't we have plenty of those?" Well, the short answer is a
resounding yes, but the idea of this library is simplicity and convenience. This library benefited a great deal from the things I liked
about the existing libraries, but hopefully offers some convenience features and simplifications that are entirely new.

Once I wrote the library I wanted to do some sanity-checking to make sure the performance wasn't substantially worse
than the existing solutions. Much to my surprise, the initial performance was generally faster than Circe or uPickle.
After some additional tuning, [Fabric][fabric] is outperforming the alternatives: [Benchmarks][benchmarks] ([Source][benchmarks-source])

[Check it out][fabric] and please give feedback if there's anything we can do to improve it.
