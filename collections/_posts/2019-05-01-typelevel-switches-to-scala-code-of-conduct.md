Typelevel is pleased to announce that we are retiring the Typelevel Code of
Conduct in favour of the [Scala Code of Conduct][scoc]. Many of the major projects
under the Typelevel umbrella have already made the switch and we will be asking
new projects that join Typelevel to adopt the new code.

The Scala Code of Conduct was developed by the Scala Center with input from
Typelevel and Lightbend, and improves on Typelevel's original in several ways.
It can be thought of as the "Typelevel code of conduct 2.0". We [endorsed it
from the outset](https://typelevel.org/blog/2016/12/17/scala-coc.html) and have
decided that now the time is right to simplify things and move to the new code
wholesale.

A shared code of conduct means a shared standard of good behaviour. Having a
single code smooths the path for participants moving between different
organizations, projects, and events in the Scala ecosystem.

The Scala Code of Conduct is supported by key Scala organizations and events,
both community and commercial: the Scala Center, Lightbend, ScalaBridge, Scala
Days amongst many others. And now Typelevel and the Typelevel Summits.

We'd love you to join us.
