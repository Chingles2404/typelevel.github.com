      <p>Typelevel is an ecosystem of projects and a community of people united to foster an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment around functional programming in Scala.</p>


      <h2>Financial Contributions</h2>

      <p>Maintaining an organization at the scale of Typelevel incurs costs.
      Through FOSS funding we can provide better support to maintainers, and make stronger guarantees to users, by paying for things like CI infrastructure or community support.</p>
      <p>Any amount of support is always welcome, and we appreciate anyone who contributes to the <a href=https://opencollective.com/typelevel>Typelevel Open Collective.</a></p>

      </br>
      <p>By funding Typelevel, you're helping us maintain our domains, infrastructure, services, and our community safety through training the Code of Conduct Committee.</p>


      <h2>Other Ways To Contribute</h2>


      <p>Companies can donate developer time by allowing developers to contribute to open source on company time, and actively encourage it by dedicating time and space for those efforts.</p>

      <p>The community can help by just getting involved, in any way that feels comfortable!
      A PR is always welcome, whether code changes or documentation improvements, and asking questions helps clarify behaviors for everyone.
      Any participation is greatly valued!</p>
